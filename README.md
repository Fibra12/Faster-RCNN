# Faster-RCNN

"Visual Inspection System for Defect Detection on Gear Surfaces Using Faster R-CNN Method" is a publication that discusses the development of a cutting-edge visual inspection system for the detection of surface defects in gears. The system is designed to detect various types of surface defects, such as cracks, scratches, or rust, using the Faster R-CNN method.

The system is built using Jetson Nano, a compact yet powerful computer designed for edge computing applications. It is also equipped with a servo that eliminates the defective gear upon detection.

One of the key features of the system is its high accuracy of detection, with a rate of 80% or above. The accuracy is achieved through the use of Faster R-CNN, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that combines region proposal networks (RPNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This combination enables the system to accurately identify and classify defects with high precision.

To ensure ease of use, the system is equipped with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5. The GUI provides live monitoring features, allowing the operator to observe the inspection process in real-time. This feature enables operators to quickly identify any issues or defects that may arise during the inspection process, allowing for prompt action.

Overall, the "Visual Inspection System for Defect Detection on Gear Surfaces Using Faster R-CNN Method" publication presents a powerful system designed to detect surface defects in gears with high accuracy and efficiency. The system is equipped with features such as live monitoring and servo-based elimination to ensure that defects are quickly and efficiently detected and removed, making it an ideal solution for industries that rely on high-quality, defect-freeÂ gears.
